# Image Bulk Submission Guide

If you have many images to contribute to SEA-VL, you are welcome to refer to this guide for bulk upload to the [SEA-VL image collection Github Repo](https://github.com/SEACrowd/sea-vl-image-collection ).

## UI Tool-based Upload

> [!TIP]
> We now have a UI tool that can make the process of adding the image descriptions and generating the required CSVs much easier!

1. Navigate into the `batch_uploader` folder. Fill out your details in the `contributor_details.yaml` file. You only need to do this the first time.
2. Place images in the `./to_upload` folder as follows:
	* Any individual images may be kept directly in the `./to_upload` folder
	* If submitting multiple images that are very closely related to each other (e.g. the same object photographed from multiple angles or with different levels of zoom), place all such images in a single sub-folder within the `./to_upload` folder
3. Run `process_and_label.py`:
	* if the csv (`seavl_batch_labels - YOUR NAME.csv`) already exists, the script will warn you: type in `y` to continue, and the script will append to the existing csv. *IMPORTANT:* if you have already submitted the csv, type in `n`, manually delete the csv, and restart the script; otherwise, duplicate entries will be created in subsequent steps of the SEA-VL pipeline
	* for each image shown, fill in the English and native language boxes, and click next. The following will happen:
		* a new line will be added to the csv
		* the image (or all the images, if the image shown was part of a sub-folder) will be added to the `../data` folder after being processed (resized and renamed as required)
		* the image or sub-folder will be moved into the `./processing_complete` folder
4. Submit your hard work:
	* raise a PR (to the `main` branch) with the new images added into the `../data/` folder
	* send us the `seavl_batch_labels - YOUR NAME.csv` CSV through Discord / email for review.

## Manual Upload

1. Upload the images to the `data` folder in this [repo](https://github.com/SEACrowd/sea-vl-image-collection).
	 - ⚠️ Please follow the current naming convention, each photo file should be named as `{file_name} - {your_name}.{extension}`.

	 - ⚠️ Keep the maximum image width/height to 2000px, so you might need to resize some images, you can use the following code to resize the image.
		```
		from PIL import Image
		image = Image.open(input_path)
		(w, h) = image.size
		if w > 2000 or h > 2000:
		    if w > h:
		        h = int(h * 2000. / w) 
		        w = 2000 
		    else:
		        w = int(w * 2000. / h)
		        h = 2000
		image = image.resize((w, h), Image.BILINEAR) 
		image.save(output_path)
		```
2. Use the CSV sample ([link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xiae0op7nj58ajt1l2yky/seavl_bulk_upload_format.csv?rlkey=izd3c28vy0b35grc1utykoxsk&dl=0)) to provide more details on the submitted photos. 
	- ⚠️ Keep the empty column as empty.
	- ⚠️ For the `email` column just fill it with seacrowd.research@gmail.com.
	- ⚠️ For the `image` column, please fill it with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEACrowd/sea-vl-image-collection/refs/heads/main/data/%7Bfile_name%7D`. `file_name` should be the same as the one you submitted to the repository.
3.  As the last step, you can send us the CSV through Discord / email (contact.ruochen@gmail.com or samuel.cahyawijaya@gmail.com) and we will review the CSV and images. If there is no issue, we will push the photos to the annotation platform.

**Any questions?** Message `@rc.z` or `@samuelcahyawijaya` on [Discord](https://discord.gg/URdhUGsBUQ)!
